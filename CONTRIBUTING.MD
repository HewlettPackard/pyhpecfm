# Contribution Guide

We welcome and encourage community contributions to pyhpecfm.

## Contributing

The best way to directly collaborate with the project contributors is through GitHub: <https://github.com/HewlettPackard/pyhpecfm>

* If you want to contribute to our code by either fixing a problem or creating a new feature, please open a GitHub pull request.
* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect, an enhancement request or a general issue, please open a GitHub issue.

Please note following guidelines for a successful PR experience

- Before making any PR please open a GITHUB issue to discuss proposed additions or changes. This will save everyone time and effort. PR's should reference the corresponding github issue. PRs without an issue will not be merged.
- PRs which do not pass CI will not be merged. Passing CI does not gurantee you will be merged. 
- PRs which add, modify, or delete code should include corresponding tests.

Note that all patches from all contributors get reviewed.
After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If the patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.
When a pull request fails review, the author is expected to update the pull request to address the issue until it passes review and the pull request merges successfully.

At least one review from a maintainer is required for all patches.
